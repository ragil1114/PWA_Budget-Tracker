# PWA_Budget-Tracker
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information at any time is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to the success of an application that handles usersâ€™ financial information. This is a full-stack budget tracker application that allows for offline access and functionality. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should update the total when brought back online.

## User Story
